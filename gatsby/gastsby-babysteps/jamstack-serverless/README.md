# Learn JAMstack Serverless in Baby Steps

Here we will learn to develop blazingly fast and scalable modern websites and apps using JAMstack, GraphQL and Serverless technologies.

In this repo we will learn how to develop JAMstack Serverless Websites and Apps using React, Gatsby.js, Contentful, Serverless Functions, Netlify, FaunaDB, Apollo, and GitHub Actions. 

If you don't have web programming background or don't know React we suggest you start from this [app development foundation bootcamp](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2020/).

Before starting the steps we suggest reading the following articles which cover the concepts, technologies, architecture and companies behind modern fullstack websites and apps:

### Modern Applications

Modern applications are built with a combination of modular architecture patterns like micro services (instead of monolithic)  and components, serverless operational models, event driven architecture, data stored in modern globally distributed databases, services connected with GraphQL Query and realtime subscription APIs, and agile developer processes that allow organizations to innovate faster while reducing risk, time to market, and total cost of ownership. Modern web apps include Single Page App (SPA) frameworks (for example, React, Angular, or Vue) and static-site generators (SSGs) (for example, Gatsby, Next, Hugo, or Jekyll). These applications do content management typically using headless CMS's. Modern applications also extensively use the power of automation with continuous integration and continuous delivery.

### SSG vs SSR vs CSR

If you build everything as a Single Page App (SPA) using React (Using Create React App) this will be the result: [Stop using React](https://dev.to/ender_minyard/why-you-should-stop-using-react-g7c). Please do read the comments in the article.

[Next.js vs. Gatsby vs. Create React App](https://leerob.io/blog/nextjs-gatsby-create-react-app)

Therefore we will be using Gatsby for JSMstack to do SSG with CSR when required. You cannot implement SSR with Gatsby, but in our opinion SSR is not Jamstack-y anyway.

[Watch Video: Episode 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONg1gpx0zlA)

We want GitHub Actions workflow that builds a static blog site and deploys on Surge. Our content is hosted on Contentful. We would like to rebuild my static site on a normal repository push event, and also via the Contentful webhook whenever our content is updated. [Reference 1](https://github.community/t/is-it-possible-to-trigger-a-single-workflow-in-github-actions-from-two-different-events/16120) [Reference 2](https://medium.com/@flawyte/zeit-now-github-action-contentful-webhook-6a697d2053cd)

Important Challenge Requirement:
We want you to build this blog site with gated content, available only for logged-in users. However we still want the blogs to be indexed for SEO reasons, and would like visitors (not logged in) have access to 3 free blogs (just like Medium), after that we want to user to get a "limited" access to each page (maybe 20 lines or so), just like news website sometimes do. The logged-in users will have unlimited access to all the blogs. We will use [Firebase authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for user logins.
