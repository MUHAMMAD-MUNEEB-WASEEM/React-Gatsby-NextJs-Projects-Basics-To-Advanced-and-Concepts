in every website folder create cname first so we can update our surge website when require

open cmd in current or website folder

->echo site-name.surge.sh >CNAME

The above is the command, just replace site name with your site name like in Redstore.surge.sh, site-name is Redstore

Then you just need to open cmd in that folder and write surge . whenever update required.
